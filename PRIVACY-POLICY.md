## Consent

By using the ProgressCount95 Discord Bot, you agree to the collection of the following information:

-  User Identifiers (IDs)
-  Message Contents (that start with numbers)

The bot does not collect any other information that is not publicly accessible via Discord.

## Information usage

We collect and store the information described above to provide the functionality of the services we offer.

-   User Identifiers are used to store information related to you which includes (but isn't limited to): correct numbers, incorrect numbers, saves, save slots, when you can claim your save next, and your current banned status from the bot.

This information (other than your banned status) may be viewed by anyone with the command `/stats user`.  Your correct numbers are also contributed to `/stats server` (grand total among all users) and `/leaderboard` (how well you are doing against all users).

## Data expiry and deletion

We **do not** remove any user information unless requested with the `/reset-data` command. Users may run this command at any time with no questions asked. The data that will be removed is your correct numbers and your incorrect numbers. **We will not clear your Saves, Save Slots, Next save claim time and banned status.**

## Security

We greatly value your trust in providing us with the information as described above, and we will always do all that we can to protect it when we store it, using any means that are commercially acceptable and available to us. However, remember that any time information is transferred over the internet, there is no method of transmission or storage that is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
