# ProgressCount95

The counting bot for the Progressbar95 Fan Server - Now open sourced by request.

**Warning: The code used for this is very half assed and very unstable.**

## Required Files

The bot requires some files to be made that have been gitignored.

- Make 2 files in `data/` called `numb.txt` and `banned.json`. These files are required for the bot to store data.

- Copy `config.json.template`, rename it to `config.json` and replace the variables with your own.

## Buidling
